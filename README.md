# SkyStadium 
# Sky Stadium 3D tour is a Virtual tour for the users to get the details of each point of the stadium. It provides the 3D view of the each point and what to expect on each floor. # It also provides the information how to reach to the stadium by different mode of transport which makes users life easy. As part of the project there was a need to take screen  # shot of the each point when users clicks on to the linke. Manully taking so many screen shot was the pain. 
# The Automation suite is created to take the photos of each page to avoid the manual work.
# this project saved the lots of efforts to take screen shot manually one by one. also this is reusable whenever there is an additional information added to the website.
